I have developed a console-based Admin Panel application utilizing core Java concepts and Java 8 features. This application enables an admin to efficiently manage users by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations while ensuring data integrity, such as preventing duplicate entries. It incorporates Java 8 Streams and functional programming for optimized data handling and offers a seamless search functionality for quick user retrieval. The application is designed with best coding practices to enhance maintainability and scalability.
